# Cifar10_DeepLearning
convolutional neural network

I tried out the parameters of model suggested in hw7 description and can not reach a accurcy of 70%. The best I got is around 68% and this model is saved in CIFAR10_myModel.h5.

I also tried out another model suggested by mtyylx on github, https://github.com/mtyylx/MLND/blob/master/P5_Image_Classification/CIFAR10%20Image%20Classification%20using%20Keras%20(Concise).ipynb. Following this model, the acc rate can be 80%. This model is saved in CIFAR10_reference.h5. My test and plot is based on this model. 
This model perform double convlution at each 3 round of CNN and add an extra dropout layer. Training time is quite long, around 10 minutes for each epoch.
